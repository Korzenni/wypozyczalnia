## Accounts model

In our application we have two types of accounts:

* Private account
* Company account

Current rules of creating those accounts:

* If you sign up for *private account* there is *no* possibility to create *company account*. In order to do that you need to sign out and in sign up tab click 'Create company account'.
* If you sign up for *company account* at the same time in database *private account* is created.
